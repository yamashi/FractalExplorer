/// @brief Generic smart pointer class that supports several deep copy ownership policies.
/// @tparam T The pointee type @n
/// @tparam OwnershipPolicy Template used for copy and destruction semantics. The policies StaticCopy, DynamicCopy and 
///  VirtualClone are shipped with the library, but you can also specify your own. A user-defined copy policy must be a class
///  template with T as template type-parameter. It has to support the following public functions (by the way, they can be
///  function templates themselves to recognize a pointer type different from T*, namely U* - the same as used in CopiedPtr(U*)
///  and Reset(U*)).
///  - <i>static T* Copy(const T* originPtr);</i>
///  @n The function performing a deep copy. Note that the @a %Copy() function is never passed a null pointer. In case an
///  empty smart pointer (pointing to @a NULL) is copied, @a %Copy() isn't invoked - i.e., both smart pointers are
///  empty after the operation. It might be of advantage if your copy mechanism checks pre- and postconditions with @a assert.
///  @n@n
///  - <i>static void Destroy(T* pointer);</i>
///  @n The function used to destroy and deallocate the held object. The three provided policies just use the delete operator.
